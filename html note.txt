The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.

The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.

Any sort of content can be put inside the <div> tag! 



The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.

The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element.



The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

<meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.

Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.
